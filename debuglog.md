## Active Issues

### Issue #002: Supabase Credentials Required
```
Date: 2024-01-12 15:00
Task: Task 2.1 Supabase Project Setup
Issue: Need actual Supabase project credentials to continue with database setup
Severity: High
Status: Blocked
Resolution: Waiting for user to provide Supabase URL and keys, or setup instructions
Time Spent: 0 minutes
Related Files: backend/.env, backend/requirements.txt
Notes: Cannot proceed with database tasks without real Supabase project setup
```

## Resolved Issues

### Issue #001: psycopg2-binary Installation Failure
```
Date: 2024-01-12 14:30
Task: Task 1.1 Backend Project Initialization
Issue: psycopg2-binary package fails to install due to missing pg_config
Severity: Medium
Status: Resolved
Resolution: Used minimal requirements without database dependencies for initial setup
Time Spent: 30 minutes
Related Files: backend/requirements-minimal.txt
Notes: Will add database dependencies in Task 2 when setting up Supabase
```

### Issue #003: Missing email-validator dependency and Pydantic Config Issues
```
Date: 2024-01-12 15:15
Task: Task 2.2 Core Database Schema Design
Issue: email-validator package not installed, and old Pydantic Config syntax causing test failures
Severity: Medium
Status: Resolved
Resolution: Added pydantic[email] to requirements, updated all models to use ConfigDict, fixed test function name collision
Time Spent: 25 minutes
Related Files: backend/requirements-minimal.txt, app/models/*.py, app/tests/test_database.py
Notes: Pytest was collecting imported test_database_connection as a test function - renamed import to avoid collision
```

### Issue #004: JWT Error Handling and Test Issues
```
Date: 2024-01-12 16:45
Task: Task 3.1 Supabase Auth Integration
Issue: JWT library error handling and test authentication middleware conflicts
Severity: Medium
Status: Resolved
Resolution: Fixed jwt.JWTError to jwt.PyJWTError, updated datetime.utcnow to timezone-aware datetime.now(timezone.utc), fixed HTTPBearer dependency with auto_error=False, added TESTING environment variable to disable middleware in tests
Time Spent: 20 minutes
Related Files: app/auth/jwt_handler.py, app/auth/middleware.py, app/auth/dependencies.py, app/tests/test_auth.py
Notes: PyJWT library uses PyJWTError instead of JWTError, datetime.utcnow is deprecated, HTTPBearer needs auto_error=False for optional auth

## Debugging Guidelines

### When to Log an Issue
1. Any error that blocks development progress
2. Unexpected behavior that takes >30 minutes to resolve
3. Performance issues affecting user experience
4. Security vulnerabilities or concerns
5. Integration problems between components
6. Test failures that require investigation
7. Deployment or environment-specific issues

### Issue Severity Levels
- **Critical**: System down, security breach, data loss
- **High**: Major feature broken, blocking issue
- **Medium**: Feature partially working, workaround available
- **Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic problem, enhancement

### Resolution Process
1. Reproduce the issue consistently
2. Identify root cause through systematic debugging
3. Document findings and attempted solutions
4. Implement fix and test thoroughly
5. Update related documentation
6. Verify fix doesn't introduce new issues

### Debug Tools and Techniques
- **Frontend**: Browser DevTools, React DevTools, console logging
- **Backend**: FastAPI automatic docs, logging, print statements
- **Database**: Supabase dashboard, SQL queries, migration logs
- **Network**: Browser Network tab, API testing tools
- **Performance**: Lighthouse, Performance tab, profiling tools

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Issues
**Common Problem**: JWT token expiration
**Solution**: Implement automatic token refresh
**Prevention**: Add token validation middleware

### Database Issues
**Common Problem**: Migration conflicts
**Solution**: Create rollback scripts, test migrations thoroughly
**Prevention**: Review migration scripts before applying

### Recording Issues
**Common Problem**: Browser permissions not granted
**Solution**: Add proper permission request handling
**Prevention**: Test across different browsers and permission states

### File Upload Issues
**Common Problem**: Large file upload timeouts
**Solution**: Implement chunked uploads with retry logic
**Prevention**: Set appropriate timeout values and file size limits

### API Integration Issues
**Common Problem**: Rate limiting from external APIs
**Solution**: Implement backoff strategy and request queuing
**Prevention**: Monitor usage and implement caching
